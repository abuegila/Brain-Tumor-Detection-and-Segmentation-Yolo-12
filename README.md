# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor MRI Dataset - YOLOv12 Segmentation (v2)

Welcome to **Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation (Yolo 12)**, a custom-curated brain tumor dataset designed for segmentation using the latest **YOLOv12** architecture. This repository provides everything you need to train, evaluate, and perform inference with a state-of-the-art segmentation model on real-world medical imaging data.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

- **Total Images**: 4,351  
- **Annotation Format**: YOLOv12 (segmentation)  
- **Image Size**: Resized to **640Ã—640** (stretched)  
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Auto-orientation of pixel data (EXIF orientation stripped)
  - Resized uniformly  
- **No Augmentation Applied**: Raw dataset with no synthetic transformations

---

## ðŸ“¥ Data Collection & Annotation

- **Sources**: The images were collected from multiple publicly available resources across the internet.
- **Annotation**: All segmentation labels were manually created by:
  - The project author
  - A certified medical doctor
- **Review**: Every annotation was carefully reviewed and verified by a professional radiologist to ensure high-quality and clinically relevant labeling.

This collaborative annotation process ensures **accuracy**, **consistency**, and **real-world reliability**, making the dataset suitable for training medical AI systems.
